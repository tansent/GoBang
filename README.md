# Battle Stage
### Key Rule: Whoever has a 5 consecutive piece line first wins the game.

Traps and bombs work in this stage. Each player can only use magic 1 time per turn.

### Spells:
* Division: Choose one of the player's own piece to cast this spell. The chosen piece will divide and 4 new pieces will occupy 4 different 
positions randomly.

* Illusion: Chose a rival's piece and disable that piece for 1 to 3 turns randomly. (After casting this spell, the player can still take a
normal move)

* Freezing: Chose a position over the board. Around the chosen position, all rivals' pieces inside the 9 spots will freeze for 2 turns. If
your rival click the freezing pieces 5 times in 3 seconds. The clicked pieces will not be frozen. (This spell does not affect plays' own 
piece.)

* Shackle: If either player casts this spell, neither players can quit the game or ask to tie before the game generates a winner.
